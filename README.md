# Football-ticketing-system
---
Football ticketing system that reads an input file as an argument line by line and executes each line contains a command and its arguments. The name of the input file will be fixed as ”input.txt” and it will be inside the folder where your python file is located. A list of available commands is given in Section 3. In our stadium, arbitrary number of categories can be created with a rectangular layout having the columns named with a sequence of 0, 1, 2, 3, ... while its rows are named with the characters of the English alphabet (A, B, C, ...., Z). In Figure 2, this scheme has been illustrated. As shown the figure, the side of each category facing the football ground will be the columns and the other side will be the rows. As a result, the number of rows of any category is limited to 26. In our stadium, you should apply three types of fares for each seat (i.e. student, full pay or season ticket). According to these tariffs, the price of student and full fare tickets will be 10 and 20 dollars, respectively. The price of a season ticket will be 250 dollars. In the following sections, you will find the descriptions of the commands and their arguments. Before delving into details please note that your program must output the results of the operations to both a console and a text file. The name of the output file will be fixed as ”output.txt” and it must be created in the same folder where your python file exists.
